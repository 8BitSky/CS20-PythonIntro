#Name
#March 12 2024
#
#Focus: EasyGUI, F-String Formatting, [Lists]
#
# Step 1: Create a simple MadLib which takes info
# from the user to create a short response. (10-15)
# Step 2: Create a Madlib which asks for multiple
# values from the user, and uses random input to
# create the final response.
