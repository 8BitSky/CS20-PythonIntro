# Tempature Conversions, Averaging, and Min/Max Calculator
# C. Slater - Assignment
# March 1, 2024
#
# Task: Take 7 temperature readings from the user (C, F or K)
# and report back the average for the week and the min and max
# values for the week in all temperature scales (C, F, and K).
#
# Use For Loops, Conditionals, lists, input, casting, comments and anything else
# from CS20 that we have discussed in class to date.
# FUNCTIONS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!
